# The Calibration Game
## How to run
Make sure that you have a React Native environment set up.  If not, [follow the instructions in this link.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

Once you do, move into the directory, and run

`npm install`

to install all the dependancies. 

(Some may not be installed, and may need to be installed manually using `npm install <package_name>`)

Then, with an Android device or emulator running, run 

`react-native run-android`

to compile the React Native project into the device, and run

`react-native start`

to start the development server.
